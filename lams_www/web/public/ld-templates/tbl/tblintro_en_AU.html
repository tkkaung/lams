<p>Your students would have gone through pre-class activities designated by you. They would form teams before completing the Individual Readiness Assessment Test (iRAT). They would then attempt the Team Readiness Assessment Test (tRAT), where the Team leader would submit the team's answer. Next, the teams would complete a number of Application Exercises.<BR/>
As a post-class activity, your students would complete a personal reflection on the key learning points.</p>
